# hello-world

Basic serverless app example answering to HTTP POST requests with a response containing "Hello World!" as body.

The [resources-config](https://github.com/rovati/agnostic-serverless/tree/main/examples/hello-world/resources-config) project is used to configure the function so that it reacts to HTTP POST requests.

The [hello-world-fn](https://github.com/rovati/agnostic-serverless/tree/main/examples/hello-world/functions/hello-world-fn) function project implements the function behaviour.
